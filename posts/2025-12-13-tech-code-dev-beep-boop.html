        I like compooter, I think code is neat, I think hardware is neat, I think hackin' is neat, I think websites is neat.
        I just don't know how to do any of it! I want to learn! I've been dabbling in websites forever but I never got more than basic HTML/CSS,
        barely got into JS. It's hard for me! And I don't know how to learn things, which is a problem in many areas of my life. What is study?
        I dunno! I never became a good musician because of it.

        I keep wanting to go into a career in this stuff. I was briefly in a computer science minor ten or so years ago until I dropped out
        of school altogether. I keep trying to self-teach, it's hard. I've completed some of the Odin Project (hey I learned very basic git there!)
        but I've been busy so I sorta dropped it. I recently listened to <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">How
        to Learn to Code and Get a Developer Job</a> from freeCodeCamp and it got me really hyped, like, the resources for me are there! That's
        something in reach! Then the next day I did nothing, then for the next month I did nothing. Though, for that specific time, I was incredibly
        burnt out from a theatre gig I had which took me a month to recover from, and then I went right into a different theatre gig. So I didn't have
        the time or energy to dig in. Maybe I'll get into the freeCodeCamp stuff after this current gig. Who knows!

        It's been a week since I started writing this post, so I don't remember where I was going with this. Maybe I wasn't going anywhere with this.
        I guess my point is that I want to learn nerd shit and have a career in nerd shit! But school isn't an option, and I don't know how well
        I can teach myself, or if my brain is even capable of learning in the first place!
      </p>
      <p>
        Or maybe my theatre career can just pick up instead lol. But I still wouldn't be satisfied because I wanna know how to code and do tech!
        I need a new brain!

      <p>I had an edible the other night, and while I was cooking dinner, I had a revelation. So, I hate cooking. Well, maybe I don't have cooking, but I hate that I HAVE to cook. So I was cooking whatever stuff I was cooking and I was like, hey I'm not having a good time. I'm not really excited for what I'm having, it's just food to get by. Then I thought some more. I thought, what's my favorite cuisine? Japanese, I think that's correct. Do I like making Japanese food? Yes I do. I find it fun and interesting and I like the result. Do I ever make Japanese food? No! Hell no. I make the occasional tamagoyaki but that's pretty much it.</p>
      <p>So then I'm like, wait, why don't I do what's fun and enjoyable? Won't I be happier doing that? Wouldn't I find it to be a mroe enriching experience? I've wanted to learn Japanese cooking before, and during pandemic lockdown I started to learn some things. But it didn't stick and now I don't do it. But it only makes sense to. Because I still *HAVE* to make food. So I should do what I can to make this necessary experience one that I would enjoy.</p>
      <p>So now what?</p>
      <p>Nothing, as it turns out. I'm so bad at actually taking the steps to improve. It's really slow for me. But now it's something I'm thinking about at least, so I'll make my way towards it I'm sure :)</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>Oh yeah, and the edible was relevant because it's what got me in the super analyzey mood I was in to even come to this.</p>

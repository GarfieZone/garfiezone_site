      <p>We look back fondly on the mid-aughts internet, what with our GeoCities and our MySpace and all that shit, filled with DIY customization. I'm really missing it, but not really in a nostalgia way. More of a decentralized social connection way, and a freedom with self-expression way. This post is an attempt to express what I like about this "web revival" movement and to convince you to join, too!</p>
      <h3>What is Neocities?</h3>
      <p>Neocities is a web hosting service. Specifically, it tries to serve the same purpose and deliver the same accessibility that GeoCities had. Additionally, there's a few social components such as following pages and an activity feed. I'm explaining it very dryly, so I'll just quote the lil blurb on their site.</p>
      <blockquote>Our mission: To make the web fun again by giving you back control of how you express yourself online.</blockquote>
      <p>Yeah. There we go. The service is free, has no ads, and 1 GB of storage. There's also a cute little HTML tutorial and some guides to help you create a rudimentary page pretty quickly. Even if you just have a few words and maybe in image and you manage to make the text blue, that's a great start! This doesnt have to be anything fancy! Which goes into my next point.</p>
      <h3>The imperfect experimental DIY nature of it all</h3>
      <p>I didn't learn any HTML until I was in my twenties, but having a Geocities site and a MySpace had me playing with it. I never did anything too fancy, a lot of the markup was probably syntactically dubious, and of course there was copy/pasting of code snippits all willy-nilly. Things would look ugly, things would destroy the layout. And that's great! That's experimentation and learning through trial and error, for the ends of having a weird lil space on the World Wide Web that is an authentic expression of yourself! And that's so much more fun than whatever we're getting on current social media. It's engaging to learn and engaging to browse sites and see how other people are expressing themselves in unique ways. It's inspiring to me.</p>
      <p>Living on Twitter or Facebook doesn't really have all that. The layouts are boring and repetative. There's hardly any customization. Hardly any visual identity that you can affect. It is a bit mind-numbing. And I totally mean that. It feels like such a passive activity, and not to get all "anti-phone boomer" on ya, but I'm finding that stepping away from phone-based social media is better for my brain and my body. Try it! Delete social media apps on your phone and just use em on a computer. We don't have to be always connected! Free yourself! Sorry, I digress.</p>

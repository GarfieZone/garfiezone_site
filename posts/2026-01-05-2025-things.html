      <p>Before 20205 ended I was going to write a post looking back on all the things
        I've done or that have happened in 2025 that I liked or whatever. A way to look
        back positively. And then I didn't write it. And then 2026 happened, and I woke
        up feeling really depressed and unaccomplished. And then I felt better. And now I'm
        going back to the idea of that post. So I guess here it goes, I hope there's actually
        enough to make me feel okay about the year.

      <ul>
        <li>I designed sound for a play that my sweetie directed</li>
        <li>I designed sound for a music at the university I used to go to</li>
        <li>I designed sound and composed music and directed an ensemble for my first
          Shakespeare play at the same university
        </li>
        <li>I ran sound for a cabaret at the theatre I used to work at, and might
          continue doing that for their future cabarets
        </li>
        <li>I finally invested in a skateboard. Bought the parts, assembled it myself, went
          out a few times trying to skate and I didn't get very far before the weather got bad,
          but I'm excited to get back into it!
        </li>
        <li>Researched and found a new washing machine, this is not that exciting but I was
          happy with the work I put in
        </li>
        <li>I started streaming regularly and became a Twitch Affiliate, and that was BEFORE
          they lowered the bar for entry into the program!
        </li>
        <li>Started working through The Odin Project. I stalled out in the CSS section, but I plan
          on continuing it. Also wanting to work through freeCodeCamp's offerings.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Oh boy, not coming up with much. Maybe I'll add more if I can think of it. But I feel like
        I'm in the same spot I was a year ago, and not feeling great about it! Will I ever learn how
        to live a life? Tune in next year to find out!

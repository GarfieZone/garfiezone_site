      <p>The title makes it sound like an essay but I'm just talking about myself for a sec lol<p>
      <p>I think it was about 2016 when I made a website in the vein of what you might find on GeoCities. I'll post it here soon, but I used basic html elements like tables and lists and found some old backgrounds and gifs so throw in, but also tried to give it minimal responsiveness so it would work on mobile and be a viable personal/profesisonal site. I wasn't going for too much nostalgia. I used some newer fonts (I think I used Roboto and Roboto Slab) and incorporated icons from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a>.</p>
      <p>It went through a few revisions I think before I started over fresh with another design concept that I started in 2020ish. Part of the page was a gallery of 3D art that I made in 2016, and I always kept that page around because it matched the art i was showcasing. I'll link to that specifically also becuase I think the art I made is a lil cool.</p>

        <li><a href="https://garfie.zone/oldsite/old/v1/3d/">The 3D art gallery</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The most recent iteration has an easter egg on the home page. If you resize the width of the browser window to the exact pixel inbetween the desktop and mobile layouts, you get a beautiful rendition of the site in Comic Sans, yellow and cyan text, and a space background. I'm really proud of that one :)</p>

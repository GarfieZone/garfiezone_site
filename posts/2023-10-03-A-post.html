      <p>I keep having ideas of what to write about and then hours later I sit down and think "wait what was I gonna say?" and then that's it.</p>
      <p>I'm wanting to add <a href="http://status.cafe">status.cafe</a> to the homepage and maybe use it to post what song is stuck in my head or an album that I'm diggin' or something. Seems fun. But the account won't activate?? I dunno. I'll figure it out eventually LOL</p>
      <p>And I really gotta sit down and think of what this site should look like. I dunno! This will be a fun journey.</p>
